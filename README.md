## Introduction
My name is Alark Bhavsar, I am a rising Junior in the College of Computer and Information Sciences at Northeastern University. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Business Administration and am set to graduate in 2019. I am just coming off my first co-op which I completed from Jan-June at Oracle doing Cloud Development. 

## Purpose of Repo
The repo created here is used for the CS4550 Web Development class. It will be where all my work will be published for both personal use as well as grading and troubleshooting help from the professor and TAs.
